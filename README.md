# vibrant-activity-feed

The project will be a responsive web page designed to mimic a 'Live Activity' feed from a site like Top Shot. It will feature a scrollable area with cards that display user activities. Each card will include a username, timestamp, description, and images. Design details will include: 
- A dark theme with a mixture of vibrant colors for the cards.
- Cards to have rounded corners and shadow for a 3D effect.
- Use of bold and bright fonts for usernames and activity descriptions.
- Implementation of a 'Reserved Packs' counter with dynamic effects.
- Images within cards showcasing product pictures with pricing information for purchased items, promotional packs, and leaderboards.
- Action buttons such as 'Check it out!' and 'Reserve Now!' which will link to other parts of the site.
- Responsiveness will ensure the layout is compatible with both desktop and mobile views.
